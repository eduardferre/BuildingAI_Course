# Intermediate level
'''
Write a program that counts the number of occurrences of "11" in an input sequence of zeros and ones. 
The input of the program is just the sequence and it should return a single number, which is the number of occurrences of "11".
'''
def count11(seq):
   # define this function and return the number of occurrences as a number
   num = 0

   while i < len(seq):

           num += 1
       i += 1

   return num

print(count11([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0])) # this should print 2

'''
Write a program that generates 10000 random zeros and ones where the probability of one is p1 and the probability of zero is 1-p1 
(hint: np.random.choice([0,1], p=[1-p1, p1], size=10000)), counts the number of occurrences of 5 consecutive ones ("11111") 
in the sequence, and outputs this number as a return value. Check that for p1 = 2/3, the count is close to 10000 x (2/3)^5 â‰ˆ 1316.9.
